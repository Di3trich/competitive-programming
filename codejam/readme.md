# Google Code Jam

[Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) is an international programming
competition hosted and administered by Google. The competition began in 2003. The competition consists of a
set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any
programming language and development environment to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code
Jam was deployed on Topcoder's platform. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure
for the contest.

Between 2015 and 2018, Google also ran Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on distributed algorithms. This
was run in parallel with the regular Code Jam, with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of
$10,000, but was only open for people who qualified to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3000 people).

Several Google Code Jam problems have led to academic research.
