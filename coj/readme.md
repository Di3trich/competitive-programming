# Caribbean Online Judge

[Caribbean Online Judge](https://coj.uci.cu/) is an online judge to train algorithm programming with
different languages. Its development began in 2006 by programmers from the UCI and others from the Caribbean
Community of the ACM-ICPC.

## Background

The base system (Xtreme Online Judge) development began in 2006 under the "Xtreme Initiative", mainly
composed by students and teachers of the 8th faculty of the University of Informatics Sciences (UCI): Tomas
Orlando Junco Vazquez, Enrique Jose Altuna Castillo, Jorge Amado Soria Ramirez, Jose Ernesto Lara Rodriguez,
Raciel Yera Toledo and Leandro Gonzalez Vallejo.

After the UCI joined the ACM-ICPC (ACM-Association for Computing Machinery, ICPC-International Collegiate
Programming Contest) movement and led the creation of the Caribbean Community of the ACM-ICPC, the Xtreme
Online Judge was selected to be published online as the COJ v1.0, and other people joined the small but
inspired development team (Yonny Mondelo Hernandez and Dovier Antonio Ripoll Mendez). The COJ is available on
the Internet since June 5, 2010.

In October 2011 the base system was replaced by another that was reprogrammed from scratch (for almost one
year) by two young students of the UCI (Juan Carlos Lobaina Guzman and Jorge Luis Roque Alvarez). Since then
the working teams and methods have been improved to get a better system.
